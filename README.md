# UIkit with React & Webpack

####Objectives
Build a minimal boilerplate for [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [UIkit](http://getuikit.com) with [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)

Currently testing it as an alternative for Bootstrap/React combo. Got inspired by this article: http://www.eugenesivokon.com/why-uikit-is-better-than-twitter-bootstrap

####Install: 
  * Fork this repo and clone your fork
  * run ```npm install``` to get React, Webpack and so
  * run ```bower install``` to get UIkit
  * create an empty folder called ```locale``` in ```bower_components/uikit/js/components``` to get rid of some warning when webpacking
  * check ```App.js``` 
  * ```npm run pack``` or 
  * ```npm run watch``` and open a browser to http://localhost:8080
